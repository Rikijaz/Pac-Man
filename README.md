# Pac-Man

# Introduction
This is an implementation of *Pac-Man*, an arcade game published by Namco. It is written in C++ and utilizes the SDL library. It is developed according to my own design specification as well as the design specifications written by Jamey Pittman in his article, [*The Pac-Man Dossier*](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier).
